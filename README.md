# Decentralized Study Timer on Core DAO

## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

The **Decentralized Study Timer** is a blockchain-based dApp built on the Core DAO network that enables students to log their study time transparently under structured milestones. By leveraging smart contracts, this platform ensures trust, progress accountability, and decentralized governance in educational or self-learning campaigns. Each campaign includes goals, contributor tracking, milestone logging, and community approval for releasing funds or tracking completion.

## ðŸ”­ Project Vision

The vision behind this project is to decentralize learning accountability using the power of blockchain. Whether itâ€™s a solo study challenge or a publicly funded educational campaign, learners can now prove their dedication and progress with immutable, verifiable logs. This model ensures that milestones are met and efforts are transparent, while also allowing communities to support and vote on learning progress.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope

- **Gamified Rewards:** Introduce token incentives or NFTs for milestone completion.
- **Study Groups:** Enable collaborative group campaigns with shared logging.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Visualize study trends and time investment for contributors.
- **AI Assistant:** Integrate study tips or personalized tracking using on-chain data and AI.
- **Mobile DApp Version:** Extend the platform to mobile devices for accessibility.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Campaign Creation**: Create decentralized learning campaigns with a funding goal and description.
- ðŸ’° **Milestone-based Contributions**: Funders can contribute and approve milestone progress.
- ðŸ—³ **DAO Voting Mechanism**: Contributors vote on whether a milestone is complete before funds are released.
- ðŸ“š **Study Logs**: Learners can submit timestamped study logs under milestones.
- ðŸ”„ **Refund Mechanism**: Contributors receive refunds if campaign goals arenâ€™t met.
- ðŸ§¾ **Immutable Records**: Logs and contributions are stored permanently on Core DAO's blockchain.
